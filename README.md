# CharityTransparency
CharityTransparency is a blockchain-based smart contract that ensures transparent, accountable, and trustless donation tracking for charitable organizations. It allows donors to contribute funds openly and enables charities to request funds with documented proof of use. All transactions, fund usage, and approvals are permanently recorded on-chain.
